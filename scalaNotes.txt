Scala

Object-oriented, functional

imports from both Java and Scala libraries
can take a list for imports
can rename imports, in case of conflicts
treats everything as an object, including "primitives" and functions

breaks handled as a separate class, functions passed to it

appears to be late binding, doesn't bind type until stated/needed

Scope is dynamic, like Java

functions with no args do not require ()

parseInt() changed to toInt, to be consistent with toString methods


Lots of support, IDE plugins with netbeans, eclipse, several small IDEs
